                        <p>
                        
                        I’m a front-end developer with a background in the creative industries, looking for my first professional tech role.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>

                        I recently completed a bootcamp with the Institute of Coding via Bath Spa University.  I'm most familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, but have also worked with back-end technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and Express, as well as generative design and UX/UI tools such as Processing, p5.js and Figma. 
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        
                        I’m coming to my new career with eight years’ experience in creative communications, having worked in both a large public organisation and a dynamic, tight knit agency.
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                        Throughout my career I’ve worked closely with high-profile clients and senior management on complex large-scale projects.  I know how to communicate effectively with people in all kinds of roles, and how to manage projects with multiple moving parts and competing deadlines.
                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        
                        I approach every project with an open mind, and I’m fired up by the chance to learn, innovate and be creative.  I’m fascinated by the creative potential of technology (I’ve been communications lead for projects like <a href = “https://creativexr.co.uk/”>CreativeXR</a> and <a href = “https://www.fachouse.com/”>Future Art & Culture</a> at the Arts Council) and I have a huge drive to develop and experiment with the ways that technical skills can address real human problems. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                        I also perform improvised comedy, which has helped me become a strong and supportive team player, as well as training me to be more adaptable, creative and comfortable with speaking and presenting.  I’m always happy to meet and build relationships with new people, and very much thrive as part of a lively and cooperative team. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                        I’m looking to join an ambitious and forward-thinking organisation where I can support the people around me while learning from experienced developers, with the opportunity to take on more complex and challenging work as I progress. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                        So, if I sound like a good fit for your team or project, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. 
                        
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        
                        Hope to hear from you soon.

                        </p>
